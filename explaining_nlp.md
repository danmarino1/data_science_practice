# <u>NLP Interview Questions</u>

## BERT Overview

### What does BERT stand for, and what is its primary purpose?
- BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
- While languages tend to read either left to right, BERT gathers context from words by interpreting both left and right. That is the 'Bi-directional' component. The encoder component utilizes a deep learning model to make encodings, or embeddings of words gping into the model and collects the semantic and syntactic essence of text data.
- These are the continuous numerical vectors produced by the encoder. They serve as a form of 'memory' for the neural network, encapsulating the information from the input data in a way that's useful for downstream tasks. Transformers are the architecture that BERT is built on. Originally designed for machine translation, the Transformer architecture has proven highly effective for a wide range of NLP tasks. It consists of an encoder and a decoder, but BERT only uses the encoder part.
### How does BERT differ from traditional language models?
BERT takes into consideration the context of words when analyzing, not just the word itself. For example, there are many words spelled the same that are different. Given the words surrounding them, we can determine what is meant. This allows for far greater precision in NLP. A sentence speaking about cards may mention a Joker, yet that often means something completely different when discussing a funny person, a comic book villain, or a card. BERT, using the context surrounding the word '93Joker'94, would understand what specifically is being spoken about.

### Explain the architecture of BERT.
Sure, let's dive into BERT's architecture! BERT stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. It's a pre-trained contextual model designed to provide dense vector representations for natural language text. Let's break down its key components:

1. **Transformers**: BERT is built on the Transformer architecture, which consists of an Encoder-Decoder structure. BERT only uses the Encoder part though.

2. **Bidirectional Context**: Unlike traditional language models that either read text from left-to-right or right-to-left, BERT reads text in both directions, which helps it understand the context better.

3. **Layers, Heads, and Hidden Units**: A BERT model can have multiple layers (e.g., BERT-Base has 12, and BERT-Large has 24). Each layer has multiple attention heads, and each head operates on hidden units. More layers, heads, and units mean more capacity to learn complex representations.

4. **Positional Encoding**: Since the Transformer architecture doesn't have a sense of the sequence order, positional encodings are added to the embeddings to provide some notion of word order.

5. **Pre-training and Fine-tuning**: BERT is first pre-trained on a large corpus of text using two main tasks: Masked Language Model (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). After pre-training, it can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like classification, entity recognition, etc.

6. **Masked Language Model (MLM)**: During pre-training, some percentage of the input tokens are replaced with a `[MASK]` token. The model then tries to predict these masked tokens based on their context, thereby learning a robust language model.

7. **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)**: In this task, the model is trained to predict whether a sentence follows another sentence in the original text, which helps in tasks like question answering and summarization.

8. **Embeddings**: BERT uses WordPiece embeddings with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The embeddings are 768-dimensional for BERT-Base and 1024-dimensional for BERT-Large.

9. **Fine-Tuning**: Once pre-trained, BERT can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create models for a wide range of tasks, like sentiment analysis or question answering, without requiring task-specific architecture modifications.


### What is the pretraining-finetuning approach used in BERT?
Pretraining and finetuning BERT involves feeding the model specific data that the trainer would like to give BERT a better understanding of. For example, if I were using BERT to further understand movie reviews, I would pre-train BERT on data related to film literature, reviews, and lessons, enabling it to more precisely identify otherwise very semantically similar words, providing more nuance to the model for this use case. (Review this to make sure it is right)

### Describe the masked language model (MLM) objective in BERT's pretraining.
In traditional language models, the objective is usually to predict the next word in a sequence given the previous words. However, BERT changes this paradigm by using MLM. Instead of predicting the next word, it aims to predict a word that has been deliberately masked out from the input sequence. This enables the model to gain much more insight than sequential predicitions.

**Masking**: During the pre-training phase, BERT takes a sentence (or a pair of sentences) and randomly masks out some percentage of the tokens. For example, the sentence "I love hiking" might become "I [MASK] hiking."
Prediction: The model then tries to predict the masked tokens based on their surrounding context. Importantly, BERT looks at both the left and the right context, making it bidirectional.
Training Objective: The objective function during training is to minimize the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual probabilities of the masked tokens. This is typically done using a form of cross-entropy loss.
Why It's Useful:
Contextual Understanding: Because BERT is bidirectional, MLM allows it to understand the context in which a word appears, making it powerful for a range of NLP tasks.
Rich Representations: The model learns not just to predict the masked word, but also to generate a rich, contextual representation of the sentence. These representations are then fine-tuned for specific tasks.
Efficiency: A single pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned for various tasks without changing the architecture, saving time and computational resources.
Robustness: The model gets exposed to a variety of sentence structures and learns to capture semantic and syntactic nuances, making it more robust.
In summary, the Masked Language Model objective allows BERT to learn by predicting missing words in a sentence, which in turn helps it understand the nuances of language, including the context in which words and phrases appear. This makes it highly versatile for a wide array of downstream NLP tasks.

### How does BERT handle bidirectional context in language understanding?
**Transformers & Attention Mechanism**:
- Transformers: At its core, BERT uses the Transformer architecture, specifically the encoder part. The Transformer architecture employs a mechanism called "attention" to process words in relation to all other words in the sentence, rather than in a fixed sequence.
- Self-Attention: In the attention mechanism, each word is weighed against every other word in the sequence. This is known as "self-attention." It helps the model look at other words to better understand the current word.
**Bidirectional Context**:
- Contextual Embeddings: When a word is processed in BERT, it's not represented in isolation. Instead, it's represented in the context of all other words in the sentence, capturing both leftward and rightward context.
- Masked Language Model (MLM): BERT's pre-training objective, MLM, involves masking some words in a sentence and asking the model to predict them. Because it has to predict a masked word based on all other words, it inherently learns to understand the context in both directions.
- Aggregation of Information: BERT uses multiple layers of these transformers, effectively allowing it to consider multiple 'hops' of context. The upper layers can capture more abstract relationships between words.
**Advantages:**
- Semantic Nuances: Bidirectional context allows BERT to capture the semantic meaning of a word in a way that unidirectional models cannot. For example, in the sentence "He was running a race," understanding both "He was running" and "a race" helps to understand that "running" here is a sport, not fleeing.
- Disambiguation: Words with multiple meanings can be better disambiguated. For example, the word "bank" in "river bank" and "savings bank" would receive different embeddings because of the surrounding context.
- Better Performance: This bidirectional understanding contributes to BERT's state-of-the-art performance on a variety of NLP tasks.
In essence, BERT's bidirectional context understanding is a result of its Transformer architecture and the MLM objective during pre-training, which together allow it to consider the full context of a wordâ€”both the words that come before it and the words that come after. This results in rich, contextual word representations.

### What are the challenges BERT addresses in natural language processing?
BERT addresses several longstanding challenges in Natural Language Processing, revolutionizing how machines understand and process language. There are several key challenges BERT tackles well:

- Understanding Context

1. **Ambiguity**: Many words have multiple meanings depending on their context. BERT's bidirectional context understanding helps to disambiguate these words effectively.

2. **Word Relationships**: Traditional models often fail to capture relationships between non-adjacent words. BERT's attention mechanism and multi-layered architecture help it understand more complex, long-range dependencies.

- Pre-training and Fine-tuning

1. **Resource Efficiency**: Traditional NLP models required task-specific architectures, resulting in the need to train separate models for each task. BERT can be fine-tuned for multiple tasks, saving computational resources and time.

2. **Data Scarcity**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model requires fewer labeled data to achieve good performance, addressing the data scarcity challenge for many NLP tasks.

- Feature Representation

1. **High-Quality Embeddings**: BERT produces richer word embeddings than earlier models, capturing not just syntactic but also semantic nuances.

2. **Versatility**: Unlike task-specific embeddings, BERT's embeddings are highly versatile and can be used across a wide range of NLP tasks.

- Complex Understanding

1. **Sentence Pairs**: BERT can work with pairs of sentences, which is essential for tasks like question-answering, text summarization, and natural language inference.

2. **Hierarchical Understanding**: BERT's multi-layered architecture allows it to capture hierarchical structures in language, understanding not just words and phrases but also the higher-level relationships between sentences.

### What are some Limitations and Challenges to using BERT

While BERT addresses many issues, it's worth noting that it also has limitations:

1. **Computational Intensity**: BERT models, especially larger variants, require significant computational resources for both training and inference.

2. **Interpretability**: Like many deep learning models, BERT is often considered a "black box," making it difficult to understand why it makes specific predictions.

3. **Token Limitations**: BERT has a maximum token limit (e.g., 512 tokens for BERT-Base), which can be a challenge for very long documents.
